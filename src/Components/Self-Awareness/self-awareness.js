          How can mental health awareness help? Mental health awareness is
          critical to promoting mental health treatment and behavioral health.
          It’s a necessary and foundational conversation for changing to a more
          proactive model of mental health. Right now, we only fill our tanks
          when they’re on “empty.” Developing our awareness helps us start to
          recognize the signs and symptoms when we’re feeling “off” — just as we
          do with physical illness. Here are four important benefits of mental
          health awareness: 1. Helps you understand your symptoms Sometimes,
          there is magic in having a diagnosis. Despite the stigma around the
          term, it’s simply a shorthand for a collection of symptoms that occur
          together. Especially with mental health conditions, which are
          difficult to pinpoint — and sometimes impossible to find — on a test,
          a diagnosis can be incredibly validating. It can help people feel less
          alone and make it easier to find treatment. Pay attention to your
          symptoms. For example, you might feel like your mental health worsens
          with social media use.

          2. Starts a conversation Mental health awareness is an ongoing
          conversation, but up until recently, it's only been had in whispers.
          But because a common feature of many moods and anxiety disorders is
          distorted thinking, talking about it can actually be immensely
          therapeutic. Building a support network and speaking with a licensed
          mental health professional is critical to alleviating symptoms of many
          mental health conditions. Unfortunately, stigma creates silence. It
          also makes it difficult to ask for support at work or in other
          environments that might be made more challenging by a mental health
          diagnosis.

          3. Better education It's crucial for caregivers, employers, parents,
          family members, and loved ones to understand the impact that mental
          health has on daily life. However, while mental health conditions can
          make daily life more difficult, they also don't have to prevent you
          from having a fulfilling and engaging life. When the people in your
          life understand and prioritize mental health care, it makes it easier
          to take the actions you need to do to take care of yourself and
          thrive.
